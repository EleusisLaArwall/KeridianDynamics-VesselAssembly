Keridian Dynamics - Vessel Assembly

Info:
This pack contains a Furnace to convert Ore to Metal and a 3D-Printer to print RocketParts from Metal. Also two launchpads that require ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads to assemble vessels from Rocketparts and some tanks to store Metal and Rocketparts. The production-chain is very basic: Ore --> Metal --> RocketParts --> Vessel.

Installation:
Make backups of your save-files. 
Copy the 'GameData' folder inside the zip file to your Kerbal Space Program directory.

Dependency:
All parts will load without any other mods installed but the Pad and OrbitalPad will have no function. The resource-config from Customisation is required for this scenario.
The Pad and OrbitalPad need ModuleManager and ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads to work.

Customisation:
This folder contains resource-definitions that are required if you don't have ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads installed. 
The ModuleManager-patches change the input-resource of the Furnace from Ore to MetalOre or MetallicOre (Not balanced; Just made sure that it doesn't violate the conservation of mass). 
To install a customisation just copy the .cfg-file somewhere in the GameData-folder.

Supported Mods:
-CommunityTechTree (config included).
-AVC

Warranty:
The Mod is in development, so no warranty if it breaks craft- or save-files. Make backups in time!
